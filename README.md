Sound2Vibe is an electronic device that converts sounds, from a pre-defined frequency range, into haptic vibrations. The vibrations are created by a coin vibration motor. These vibrations can be felt through the skin or through bone conduction. Holding the vibration motor against the bone behind the ear or against the chest bone appears to produce the best effect.

The prototype shown above converts low frequency sounds like music bass and video game gun shots (30Hz - 500Hz). It's powered by a 9V battery and  plugs into mobile phones and laptops via a headphone jack. It’s important to note that the circuit is just a proof of concept that I fabricated using components I had available. It works but the circuit design still needs to be engineered. For example, the transistors are not correctly rated for the motor current and the motor is being run above its rated voltage.

This device can be made at home by anyone with a basic knowledge of analog electronics. In fact the circuit can be bread-boarded in less than an hour. If you have no electronics knowledge then I recommend taking this Udemy course by Ian Juby. He will teach you everything you need in order to understand this circuit. The course has subtitles and is therefore accessible to deaf students.<br>

<b>Next Step</b>
<br>
Field test the prototype to assess whether or not this device sparks any excitement. In other words, does it solve a real problem?

<br>
To date the development process has been iterative and messy. Here are a few failures...

### Notes

1- I added a diode across the motor to prevent damage to the circuit by flyback voltage. This is not shown on the wiring diagram, but the diode is shown on the image above.
