# Bone-Viber
An  electronic open source music and gaming aid for the deaf.<br>
Plug the audio jack into a phone or laptop. Stick the coin vibrating motor to your body - wrist, ear bone, chest bone etc. - using masking tape or bandage tape. This device will help you feel music bass, video game sounds or spoken words as vibrations.

The Bone Viber is an electronic device that converts sounds, from a pre-defined frequency range, into haptic vibrations. The vibrations are created by a coin vibration motor. These vibrations can be felt through the skin or through bone conduction. Holding the vibration motor against the bone behind the ear or against the chest bone appears to produce the best effect.

The prototype shown above transmits low frequency sounds like music bass and video game gun shots (30Hz - 500Hz). It's powered by a 9V battery and  plugs into mobile phones and laptops via a headphone jack. Itâ€™s important to note that the circuit is just a proof of concept that I fabricated using components I had available. It works but the circuit design still needs to be engineered. For example, the transistors are not correctly rated for the motor current and the motor is being run above its rated voltage.

This device can be made at home by anyone with a basic knowledge of analog electronics. In fact the circuit can be bread-boarded in less than an hour. If you have no electronics knowledge then I recommend taking this excellent Udemy course by Ian Juby. He will teach you everything you need in order to understand this circuit. The course has subtitles and is therefore accessible to deaf students.<br>

Check if this prototype solves a real problem for deaf music lovers and gamers. In other words ... is there product-market-fit?

<br>
To date the development process has been iterative and messy. Here are a few failures...
