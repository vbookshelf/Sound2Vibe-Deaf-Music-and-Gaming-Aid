The Bone Buzzer is a simple  electronic device that converts sounds, from a defined frequency range, into haptic vibrations. The vibrations are created by a coin vibration motor. These vibrations can be felt through the skin or through bone conduction. Holding the vibration motor against bone behind the ear or against the chest bone appears to produce the best effect.

The prototype shown above transmits low frequency sounds like music bass and video game gun shots (30Hz - 500Hz). It's powered by a 9V battery and  plugs into mobile phones and laptops via a headphone jack. Itâ€™s important to note that the circuit is just a proof of concept that I fabricated using components I had available. It works but the circuit design still needs to be engineered. For example, the transistors are not correctly rated for the motor current and the motor is being run above its rated voltage.

I will update this repo as the project progresses. If you have questions or would like to offer advice, please click the 'Discussions' option above to leave a comment.

Check if this prototype solves a real problem for deaf music lovers and gamers. In other words ... is there product-market-fit?

<br>
To date the development process has been iterative and messy. Here are a few failures...
